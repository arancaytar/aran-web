Hi, I'm [Aran](/about). This is my personal site, and the repository of some
small utilities and resources I have created over the years.

The site itself has been around in one form or another since 2006. In its
current incarnation, the site is built using the static site generator
[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/). The PHP-based site remains online at
[https://ermarian.net/](https://ermarian.net/), and still contains far more content
that has yet to be migrated.
