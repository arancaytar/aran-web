Hi, I'm [Aran](/about). This is the center of a loose collection of
purpose-specific sites hosted under ermarian.net. These sites mostly relate to
the community of the [Spiderweb Software](http://www.spidweb.com/) games and the
fantasy world [Ermarian](https://encyclopedia.ermarian.net/).

It is also my personal home page, and the repository of many small utilities
and resources I have created over the years.

In its current incarnation, this site is built using the static
site generator [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).
