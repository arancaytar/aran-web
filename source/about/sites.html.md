This is a list of sites that I currently maintain.

* [The Encyclopedia Ermariana](https://encyclopedia.ermarian.net/), a wiki that
  collects information on the setting of the [Avernum](http://www.avernum.com/)
   / Exile RPG series by [Spiderweb Software](https://www.spidweb.com/).
* [The Pied Piper Project](https://pied-piper.ermarian.net/), an archive of old
  posts on the official forums of the same game.
* [The NationStates Jolt Archive](https://nationstates.ermarian.net/jolt/), an
  archive of an older forum of the [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.com/)
  community.
* [The Ermarian Network](https://ermarian.net/), the previous version of *this*
  site, based on a custom-written PHP template system.

I currently also serve as one of the administrators of [Calamity Refuge](https://calref.net/),
a small creative community loosely affiliated with the Spiderweb Software fandom.
