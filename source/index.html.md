Hi, I'm [Aran 🐴](/about); I do things with code. This is my personal site, and the
repository of some small utilities and resources I have created over the years.

The site (originally the Ermarian Network) has been around in one form or
another since 2006. The PHP-based version remains online at [https://ermarian.net/](https://ermarian.net/),
and still contains much content that has yet to be migrated.

In its current incarnation, the site is built using the static site generator
[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).
