title: Security

I have a PGP key ([0x53ef6955](pgp.txt)) and used to occasionally sign
outgoing emails. However, I do not have the infrastructure to securely use this
key on a mobile device, which is how I send and receive nearly all emails.

I recommend that, if you are in doubt as to any message received from me, or
want to communicate securely, you attempt to reach me through another channel
that is harder to compromise than email.
