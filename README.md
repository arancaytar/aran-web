# aran-web

This is the source code of my personal website, running on https://aran.horse/.

The site is generated by [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).

Local development currently requires a workaround
([nginx reverse proxy](https://gist.github.com/arancaytar/a11b02bd6306bf6a62bd16e7e139b13b))
for resolving clean URLs.

Deployment is performed automatically by merging to the master branch of this repository.

Pull requests welcome!
