I used to have a PGP key and occasionally signed outgoing emails,
when it was convenient because I was on my laptop and using the
desktop email client.

In practice, I will usually be on my phone or in the
web mail interface, where it is inconvenient to use PGP. Whether or not my
emails are signed is therefore not a good test for authenticity.

I recommend that, if you are in doubt as to any message received from me, or
want to communicate securely, you attempt to reach me through another channel
that is harder to compromise than email.
