Welcome to the Ermarian Network; I am [Aran](/about). This is the center of a
loose collection of purpose-specific sites hosted under ermarian.net. These sites
mostly relate to the community of the Spiderweb Software games and the fantasy
world Ermarian (hence the name).

It is also my personal home page, and the repository of many small utilities
and resources I have created over the years.

In its current incarnation, the Ermarian Network is built using the static
site generator Middleman.
