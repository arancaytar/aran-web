title: About
---
I'm Aran, also known as Arancaytar. I do a lot of stuff with websites,
mostly using [PHP](https://php.net/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).
I currently live and work in Zurich, Switzerland, and have previously spent most
of my life in Germany (studying in Aachen, Frankfurt and Berlin).

I have been (or still am) active in the following online communities, and some
of their satellites:

- [Spiderweb Software](https://spiderwebforums.ipbhost.com/) (2003 to now)
- [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/) (2004 to now)
- [Santharia](http://www.santharia.com/) (2003 to 2006)

## Main interests

- All kinds of programming languages. My current favorites are Python and PHP,
  but I've dabbled in Java, JS and Haskell, and occasionally touched Lua and Ruby.
- Logic and computational complexity, my main focus while studying computer science.
- I'm trying to pick up the basics of Machine Learning.
- [Ponies](https://www.fimfiction.net/).

## Contact

- I can be reached by email at [aran@ermarian.net](mailto: Aran <aran@ermarian.net>).
  (I used to recommend my PGP key ([`0x53EF6955`](/about/pgp.txt)) at this point,
  but frankly I am no longer convinced it's a [worthwhile security measure](/about/security).)
- I am active on Twitter as [@arancaytar](https://twitter.com/arancaytar).
- I have a GitHub account at [@arancaytar](https://github.com/arancaytar), but
  as most of my dev work so far has been under another identity, it's very empty.
