I have a PGP key ([`0xE9B3CEC3`](/about/pgp.txt)). I may occasionally sign
outgoing emails, when it is convenient because I'm on my laptop and using the
desktop email client. In practice, I will usually be on my phone or in the
web mail interface, where it is inconvenient to use PGP. Whether or not my
emails are signed is therefore not a good test for authenticity.

You may, if you wish, send me encrypted emails, but in practice that just means
I won't be able to read them on the go.

I recommend that, if you are in doubt as to any message received from me, or
want to communicate securely, you attempt to reach me through another channel
that is harder to compromise than email.
