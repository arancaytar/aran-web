I'm Aran, sometimes known as Arancaytar. I do a lot of stuff with websites,
mostly using PHP and Drupal. I currently live and work in Zurich, Switzerland,
and have previously spent most of my life in Germany (studying in Aachen,
Frankfurt and Berlin).

I have been (or still am) active in the following online communities, and some
of their satellites:

- [CalRef](https://calref.net) (2012 to now)
- [Spiderweb Software](https://spiderwebforums.ipbhost.com/) (2003 to now)
- [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/) (2004 to now)
- [Santharia](https://www.santharia.com/) (2003 to 2006)

Main interests:

- All kinds of programming languages. My current favorites are Python and PHP,
  but I've dabbled in Java, JS and Haskell, and occasionally touched Lua and Ruby.
- Logic and computational complexity, my main focus while studying computer science.
- I'm trying to pick up the basics of Machine Learning.
- Ponies.
